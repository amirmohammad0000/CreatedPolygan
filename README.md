# createdPolygan


This is a Mini Library For Create Polygans.


This mini library can create small colored circles for you that have a beautiful effect for the site. Working with this library is very simple.


In this link you can see what this library makes for you====https://github.com/amirmohammad0000/createdPolygan/blob/main/Document.pdf


Get started with this library.


You can download these beautiful shapes by downloading this file and using it in the project====https://github.com/amirmohammad0000/createdPolygan/blob/main/createPolygan.js


You can use this link to see an example====https://github.com/amirmohammad0000/createdPolygan/blob/main/example.html


To use this library, we need 2 things: You need to apply the ID "created____polygan" to the tag you want, and apply the "onmousemove" event to the tag, and write the name of this function "create____polygan" inside this event.


You can apply 6 parameters to the function, if you do not apply the parameters, there is no problem, but these 6 parameters are for custom settings.


The first parameter is for the size of the circles. The smaller the number, the smaller the size of the polygons, and the larger the number, the larger the size of the polygons.


The second parameter is for the width of the polygons. The larger the number, the thicker the polygons, and the smaller the number, the smaller the size of the polygons.


The third parameter is for the type of shape of the polygons. I used border so you can use parameters like "solid" or "dotted" or other parameters that can be given to a border.


The fourth parameter is border radius and is a property for borders. The higher the number, the rounder the corners and the closer the shape to the circle, and the lower the number, the sharper the corners and the closer the shape to the square.


The next parameter is "z-index", the same parameter used in elements for when you want to have one element at the top and one element below. If this number is smaller than the other "z-indexes" in your project, the formed polygons will be placed below those elements.


The next parameter is the disappearance parameter, which should be in milliseconds, ie if you set this number to "1000", these polygons will be destroyed after 1 second and completely removed from the screen, and if this number is "10000", these polygons will be removed after 10 Seconds will be destroyed.


And finally, thank you very much for using this small library.
